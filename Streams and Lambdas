Lambda and Streams:
They both help you write code in a concise way. 

What is functional programming?:
This puts its focus towards functions rather than objects and classes.
The functions give you the same output each time you give the same input. 
Functions can take other functions as input and produce them as outputs. 
This helps with writing clean code and we use Lambdas and Streams to help enable functional style programming. 

Lambdas:
Functional interfaces: this contains only one abstract method. To help avoid any errors and allow only one abstract method within an interface we use the @FunctionalInterface annotation.
Using lambdas: they help with writing an anonymous function(a function with no name) by providing implementation directly instead of making a new class to implement the functional interface. 
Ex of lambda expressions: Greeting greet = () -> System.out.println(“Hello”);
Using existing interfaces: java has interfaces that are already created that you can use at your disposal. 

Streams API:
This allows us to chain a group of elements together and it can be used alongside lambdas. 
The streams API supports operations like filtering, mapping, and sorting elements in a collection.
Streams are immutable, meaning you can't change the original data while processing it.
There are two types of operations within Streams such as intermediate which is map, filter and sorted and they return a stream. 
The second type is terminal operations like forEach that returns a final result. They must come last. 
Create a stream from an array:  Stream<String> shoppingListStream = Stream.of(“a”, “b”);
How to sort items alphabetical and use methods to print it out: shoppingListStream.sorted().forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));
